/*
 * Every animation on the page that is not a hover, in one place.
 *
 * This started as a pure-CSS system built on `animation-timeline: view()`,
 * which was cheaper and worse. A view timeline maps scroll position to
 * animation progress exactly: move the wheel one notch and the type moves one
 * notch, and because a wheel notch is a jump rather than a sweep, so is the
 * type. It is technically the smoothest thing a browser can do and it reads as
 * the least smooth, because there is nothing between the input and the output.
 *
 * What was missing is lag. `scrub` here is a number rather than `true`, which
 * tells ScrollTrigger to *ease toward* the scroll position over that many
 * seconds rather than snap to it, so a notch of wheel becomes a short sweep and
 * a flick becomes a glide that settles after you have stopped.
 *
 * Once a tween engine is on the page it should be doing the whole job rather
 * than three effects, so the hero's entrance moved here too. It used to be four
 * CSS keyframes and five hand-counted `animation-delay` values across two
 * files, which is a timeline written in the least convenient notation there is.
 * As a `gsap.timeline` the delays are positions, the order is readable in one
 * column, and changing the pace is one number instead of five.
 *
 * The cost: 46 KB gzipped for the core and ScrollTrigger, 7 more for SplitText,
 * and animation on the main thread rather than the compositor.
 *
 * Nothing in here is required for the page to be readable. Every element is
 * rendered in its finished state and GSAP moves it *back* to the start, so a
 * reader with no JavaScript, a bot, or anybody whose bundle failed to load gets
 * the whole page rather than a column of nothing. That is also why `matchMedia`
 * is used rather than a bare check: `mm.revert()` puts every element back
 * exactly as it was found, including the text SplitText pulled apart, if the
 * reader turns reduced motion on while the page is open.
 *
 * **Every tween is `fromTo` with both ends written out, and that is not
 * verbosity.** A bare `from()` reads its destination off the DOM when it
 * renders, and ScrollTrigger calls `invalidate()` on refresh, which it does on
 * `load` once the screenshots have decoded. A tween that had already applied
 * its start state by then re-read its destination out of that start state and
 * animated zero to zero. It was silent and it cost an afternoon: the two
 * download buttons were simply not on the finished page. Naming both ends
 * makes a refresh a no-op.

 * Where a section's title starts and finishes arriving.
 *
 * Opened out from `88% -> 42%`, and again from `95% -> 38%`, because the
 * distance the type travels went up by an order of magnitude. Each line starts
 * a full viewport width off the side of the screen rather than 13% of its own
 * width in from it, and covering that in the old range meant a word crossing
 * the whole screen inside a third of a scroll: legible as a blur, not as an
 * arrival. This is roughly two thirds of a screen of scroll for the pair.
 *
 * The range is the *rate* control. Travel is fixed at one viewport width, so
 * the only way to make a title move more slowly is to spend more scroll
 * covering it; shortening the durations below would just make it snap sooner.

 * because that is the knob anybody adjusting the feel actually reaches for.
 * `scrub` is a lag, not a duration: ScrollTrigger eases *toward* wherever the
 * scroll is over this many seconds, so a wheel notch becomes a sweep and a
 * flick becomes a glide that keeps going after the wheel has stopped.
 *
 * Raised across the board from `0.7-1.0`. Under a second the type tracks the
 * wheel closely enough that a fast scroll reads as the page being yanked
 * rather than as anything arriving, which is exactly the complaint. Past about
 * 2 it stops reading as momentum and starts reading as latency: the page feels
 * like it is buffering. These sit in the band where the movement is clearly
 * its own thing and still obviously caused by the scroll.
 *
 * Titles get the most because they travel the furthest. Parallax gets more
 * still because it is the one effect with no destination to arrive at, so
