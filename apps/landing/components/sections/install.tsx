 * The one lime surface on the page.
 *
 * Everything above it is a true-black canvas with the accent rationed to a
 * full stop, a rule and a dot, because that is how the app treats it. Spending
 * the whole colour at the end, once, on the only thing the page is asking
 * anybody to do, is what makes the rationing read as deliberate rather than as
 * a page that ran out of ideas.
 *
 * The type on it is `--volt-ink`, the app's own foreground for a lime fill.
 * White here measures around 2:1.
