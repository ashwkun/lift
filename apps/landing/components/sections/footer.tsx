 * One row of four, down from three headed columns of ten.
 *
 * Six of the ten were already on the page, deep-linked from the section that
 * makes the claim they settle: the privacy ledger points at the dependency
 * list and the update notes, the self-hosting section points at the deploy
 * guide and the server. A footer that repeats them is not a second chance to
 * find them, it is the same links again under a heading, and three headings
 * over four links each is a sitemap for a repository with one page in it.
 *
 * What is left is the four a reader could not have reached by reading: the
 * repository, the list of builds, and the two licence documents.
 *
 * `Third-party notices` is not an ordinary link and is not a candidate for the
 * next trim. The app's anatomical artwork and its volume-landmark model derive
 * from LiftShift under AGPL-3.0, and NOTICE.md is where that attribution
 * lives. **Do not drop it.**
