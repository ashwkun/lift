/*
 * A wordmark, three links and the one button the page is asking anybody to
 * press.
 *
 * The progress rule came out of here. It was borrowed from the app, which puts
 * how much of the workout is left across the top of the workout screen, and
 * the borrowing was the mistake: a workout has an end you are working toward
 * and a marketing page does not. What it actually reported was how much
 * scrolling was left, which is a fact about the document rather than about
 * anything the reader wants, and it put a moving lime bar across the top of
 * every screenshot on the page. It also cost the only per-frame work in this
 * component.
 *
 * Three section links, down from six plus a Source link. Six is a table of
 * contents, and a table of contents is what you build when you do not trust
 * the page to be worth scrolling. These three are the argument: what it looks
 * like, that it works with the network off, and that you can run the server.
 * Everything else is reached by reading, which is the intended way through.
 *
 * Source went with them. It is in the hero, in the footer twice, and behind
 * the button's neighbour in every section that makes a checkable claim.
 *
 * Nothing in here re-renders. The spy sets `data-active` on a link and the
 * sentinel toggles one attribute on the header; putting either into React
 * state would re-render the header down the length of the page.
