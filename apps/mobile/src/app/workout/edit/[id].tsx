/**
 * Correcting a session that is already in the log.
 *
 * The logging screen is the only place in the app that can change a set, and it
 * only ever opens on the session in progress, so a weight typed into the wrong
 * row, a set that was logged twice, or an exercise recorded under the wrong
 * name was permanent the moment Save was pressed. The only remedy the app
 * offered was to delete the whole session and re-enter it from memory.
 *
 * This is that screen again, pointed at a finished workout. It is deliberately
 * the same components: `ExerciseBlock`, `SetRow`, the reorder sheet, the rest
 * editor, because the gesture for fixing a set has to be the gesture for
 * logging one; a second, read-only-ish editor with its own affordances would be
 * a second thing to learn for the rarer of the two jobs.
 *
 * What it is *not* is the logging screen: no rest timer, no keep-awake, no
 * notifications, no finish flow. Nothing here is happening now.
 *
 * The one thing it owes that the logging screen doesn't is arithmetic. A
 * finished session stores its own totals and its records, and every screen in
 * the app reads those stored figures rather than the sets, so an edit that
 * only wrote rows would leave the history card, the muscle split and the
 * trophy in the state they were in before. `recalculateWorkout` is what puts
 * them back in agreement, and it runs on the way out.
