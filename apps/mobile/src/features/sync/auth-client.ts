 * and the API being on unrelated domains.
 *
 * **`credentials: 'include'`** is what lets a browser attach the session cookie
 * it already holds for the API's origin. Every call the auth client makes has
 * had this from the start (better-auth's own config sets it) and this one
 * request did not, which is the whole reason a signed-in browser was getting
 * 401s from sync while sign-in itself worked.
 *
 * **The `Cookie` header** is native-only, and not by preference: `Cookie` is a
 * forbidden header name in browsers, so `fetch` strips it without a word.
 * React Native's fetch is not a browser's and does send it, which is what has
