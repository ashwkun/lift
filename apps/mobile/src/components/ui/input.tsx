 * the set row writes every keystroke to SQLite and reads the number back
 * through a live query and a kilogram conversion. Rendering that echo directly
 * makes the field fight the user — 225 entered in pounds returns as "225.0", a
 * typed "." disappears because it parses to nothing new, and a half-typed "290"
 * can be rewritten between two keystrokes. So the raw string lives here while
 * the field is focused, and the echo is ignored.
 *
 * Re-sync happens on blur, and while focused whenever an incoming `value`
 * matches none of the strings this field still has in flight. That second
 * clause is what makes the set row's Previous column work: the scroll view it
 * sits in sets `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"`, so tapping Previous
 * copies last session's numbers in *without* blurring the field, and a
 * blur-only re-sync would quietly drop them. `selectTextOnFocus` makes a re-sync invisible on the
 * way in, since the text is being replaced while it is selected anyway.
 *
 * There is deliberately no debounce on the write this buffer feeds. `Finish`
 * lives in the header outside the scroll view and does not reliably blur the
 * focused field, and a swipe-delete can destroy the row before any blur, so a
 * pending keystroke would be the last weight of the session. The buffer already
 * removes the reason anyone wanted a debounce, which was latency, not writes.
